              Hello! Thank you for showing an interest in my portfolio. I was born and raised, with a family of five, in Sri Lanka.
              I have two brothers and I am the youngest in my family. At age 13, a sixth member to our family was added, Toby, my dog.
              I recieved my primary education in Sri Lanka and when it was time for me to attend college, I decided to migrate to the United States.
              I was later admitted to the School of Engineering at The University of Kansas as an undergraduate student to study Chemical Engineering.
              Towards the end of my degree I was introduced to the world of programming and ever since my interest in this art of creation has only increased.
              As I started teaching my self how to program, the most valuble lesson that I learned was that self teaching is key to quench ones thirst for
              knowledge.

            I graduated from The University of Kansas in the Spring of 2020 as a Bachelor in Science in Chemical Engineering with a cumilative GPA of 3.71.
            During my undergraduate degree I found my self interested in computer programming. Therefore I taught my self how to program in Python and it changed the entire focus of my career.
            I completed a Python Specialization course offered by University of Michigan via Coursera. In the Fall of 2020 I was admitted by KU to pursue
            my Master's degree in Chemical Engineering.I am expecting to graduate in the Spring of 2021. As a Master's student I am studying how to to use
            machine learning to make usefull predictions in Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy. During my Master's program I also learned Front-end web engineering. I successfully 
            completed a Web Design Specialization offered by University of Michigan via Coursera.

          Other than programming and Front-end web engineering, I like to spend my leisure time playing the guitar and singing. I taught my self how to play the guitar at the age of 13. Ever since
          I have been playing the guitar as a hobby. I also learned how to play the piano at the age of 15. When I started going to college I became curious about how
          iconic individuals such as political leaders, scientists, journalists and other world leaders gained their success. As a result I started reading their 
          autobiographies and personal growth books. It is safe to say that this is the most valuable hobby I have to date.
